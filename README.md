# Using Gemini to check links

* Use a combination of Gemini, browser automation and glue code to navigate through all
  the links in a set of topics to check whether the destination contains an
  error or a mismatch between the link text and prominent text at the destination

* The notebook generates an interactive report where you can see which links have errors or mismatches associated with them
